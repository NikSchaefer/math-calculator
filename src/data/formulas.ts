      "Converts normalized frequency (f) to angular frequency (ω) in the digital domain.\n\n**Formula:** ω = 2πf\n\n**Units:** ω is in radians per sample, f is in cycles per sample (dimensionless).\n\n**Why it works:** Angular frequency represents the rate of change of phase angle in radians, with one complete cycle being 2π radians.\n\n**Example:** A normalized frequency of 0.25 cycles/sample corresponds to ω = 2π(0.25) = π/2 radians/sample.",

    name: "Aliasing Condition",
    description:
      "Determines whether aliasing will occur by comparing the signal frequency (F) to the Nyquist frequency (fs/2).\n\n**Formula:** Aliasing occurs when F > fs/2\n\n**Units:** Both F and fs are in Hertz (Hz).\n\n**Why it works:** When a signal's frequency exceeds the Nyquist frequency (half the sampling rate), it creates false lower-frequency components in the sampled signal. This is because the sampling rate is too low to capture the signal's true oscillations.\n\n**Example:** For a system sampling at 44100 Hz:\n- A 20000 Hz signal: 20000 < 44100/2 (22050 Hz) → No aliasing\n- A 30000 Hz signal: 30000 > 44100/2 (22050 Hz) → Aliasing occurs, appears as 14100 Hz signal\n\nThe aliased frequency can be calculated as: |fs - F| for F > fs/2",
